The webpage includes a summary about me, some photos of me and my friends (and coffee, because I love coffee!!!),
my personal playlist, like and share buttons for facebook (please do!), a QR code you can share with your friends
if you or they don't have facebook, answers to two questions and a form you can fill (and add as many emoji you
want to the content) which will craft an email that you can send to me.
There is a toolbar at the top you can use in order to navigate through the page.
